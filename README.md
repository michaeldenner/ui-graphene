# ui-graphene
User interface to compute electronic properties of multilayer graphene systems

## Capabilities

Sheets and ribbons module for:
- Monolayer
- Bilayer
- Trilayer
- Twisted bilayer graphene

## Requirements

Parts of the code rely on Python libraries

- numpy
- matplotlib
- pyqt5 (for user interface)
- pygra (for twisted bilayer graphene systems)

## Usage

```python
python launch_interface.py

```
